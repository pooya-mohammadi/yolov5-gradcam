# YOLO-V5 GRADCAM

I constantly desired to know to which part of an object the object-detection models pay more attention. So I searched for it, but I didn't find any for Yolov5.
Here is my implementation of Grad-cam for YOLO-v5. To load the model I used the yolov5's main codes, and for computing GradCam I used the codes from the gradcam_plus_plus-pytorch repository.
Please follow my GitHub account and star ⭐ the project if this functionality benefits your research or projects.

## Update:
Repo works fine with yolov5-v6.1


## Installation
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Infer
`python main.py --model-path yolov5s.pt --img-path images/cat-dog.jpg --output-dir outputs`

**NOTE**: If you don't have any weights and just want to test, don't change the model-path argument. The yolov5s model will be automatically downloaded thanks to the download function from yolov5. 

**NOTE**: For more input arguments, check out the main.py or run the following command:

```python main.py -h```

### Custom Name
To pass in your custom model you might want to pass in your custom names as well, which be done as below:
```
python main.py --model-path cutom-model-path.pt --img-path img-path.jpg --output-dir outputs --names obj1,obj2,obj3 
```

## Note
I checked the code, but I couldn't find an explanation for why the truck's heatmap does not show anything. Please inform me or create a pull request if you find the reason.

This problem is solved in version 6.1

## TO Do
1. Add GradCam++
2. Add ScoreCam
3. Add the functionality to the deep_utils library
